## Sorry - React
This is a React version of the board game Sorry that I wrote for fun. It uses Redux for the different states used in the gameplay: where the pieces are, what number card is showing, etc.

If you want to see it in use, you will need to downgrade your Node version. I am currently used v16.20.2 for it.
From that, you install Yarn using NPM & then use Yarn to install everything else.
